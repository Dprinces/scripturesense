# ScriptureSense Demo Script

Use this script when presenting ScriptureSense to church leadership or media teams. The goal is to demonstrate **speed, accuracy, and control**.

## Setup (2 Minutes)
1.  Open your presentation software (e.g., EasyWorship) on the projector/secondary screen.
2.  Open **ScriptureSense Controller** on the laptop screen.
3.  Select the correct profile (e.g., "EasyWorship").
4.  Ensure **Auto Mode** is **ON**.

## The Demo (3 Minutes)

### 1. The Introduction
> "Pastors often read scripture faster than we can type it. Today, I want to show you a tool that listens to the sermon and puts the verses on screen automatically."

### 2. The "Magic" Moment
*   Click **START LISTENING**.
*   Say clearly and naturally:
    > "Let's turn in our Bibles to **John chapter three verse sixteen**."
*   *Pause and point to the screen.*
*   (The system will count down 1.5s and then display the verse on EasyWorship).

### 3. Rapid Fire Test
> "It also handles rapid references."
*   Say:
    > "Now flip over to **Genesis one verse one**."
*   (Wait for display).
    > "And finally, **Psalm twenty-three verse one**."

### 4. The Safety Feature (Critical)
*   Switch **Auto Mode** to **OFF**.
> "If you're worried about mistakes, we can turn off Auto Mode."
*   Say:
    > "Let's look at **Romans 8:28**."
*   *Point to the ScriptureSense UI.*
    > "See? It caught the verse, but it didn't send it to the screen. It waits for the operator to click 'SEND NOW'."
*   Click **SEND NOW**.

## Closing
> "This system works offline, doesn't need internet, and works with the software we already use. It's like having a dedicated assistant just for scriptures."
